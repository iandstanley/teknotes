	Google Drive
	Google Photos
	Google Cloud Storage

	local filesystem

It is supported on many distributions including Debian and FreeBSD.

Debian packages:

	rclone 
	rclone-browser 
	git-annex-remote-rclone


FreeBSD packages:

	rclone
	rclone-browser

Rclone is great for off site backups and you can even encrypt your
backups.

Once setup with 'rclone config' you can also do:

	$ rclone copy myfile.txt iandropbox:/mystuff/

You can even encrypt remotes by choosing 'crypt' as the target
remote.

Use 'rclone config' then select 'n' for new remote and choose
'crypt'.

You then add a path to store onto. This can be a local directory
or on a previously configured remote eg. Dropbox.

We can then choose whether to encrypt our filenames.

It then asks for a passphrase.

This only uses symmetric encryption. You could however encrypt you
backup with a gpg key before running rclone to copy it to the cloud.
