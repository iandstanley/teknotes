		       SQUID VS SOCKS5 PROXY



We will look at the differences between a Squid proxy and SOCKS5
proxy.



	--------------------------------------------------------------


		HOW TO CREATE A SQUID PROXY SERVER


To install Squid:


	$ ssh squid@myproxy

	$ sudo apt install squid

	$ cd /etc/squid

	$ sudo cp squid.conf squid.conf.default

(Or we could override with /etc/squid/conf.d/*.conf)

Now uncomment:

		#http_access  allow localnet

		http_access allow localnet


	$ sudo systemctl restart squid

	$ sudo systemctl status


Squid is now running.


We can test this out using Postman.  Goto Settings -> Proxy. Deselect
'Use System Proxy', and check 'Use Custom Proxy'.  Add details of
your proxy. Now we can make a request from ifconfig.me which will
tell us our public address.

We get a '200 OK' response back together with our proxy's IP address.

To confirm this worked we can also look at an access log that squid
has.


	$ sudo tail  /var/log/squid/access.log


And as we can see in the log file we have a 200 indicating a success:


	GET http://ifconfig.me TCP_TUNNEL /200


Now lets add a little bit more security. First lets add basic
authentication.


	$ sudo vi /etc/squid/squid.conf


Just before the 'ACL' section add:


	auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid/basic_ncsa_auth
					     etc/squid/htpasswd

	auth_param basic realm Squid Proxy Caching Web Server

	acl authenticated proxy_auth REQUIRED

	acl authenticated_ips src 192.168.45.5/32


Where 192.168/45/4 is the IP address of my computer.

And now we go back to the http_access section we uncommented earlier
to add the acls.


	# http_access allow localnet

	http_access allow authenticated authenticated_ips


To use our proxy you will need to have the password and come from
a specified IP address.

Now we create a password file. Enter the following, replacing
USERNAME and PASSWORD with the username and password that you want
to use.


	$ printf "USERNAME:$(openssl passwd -crypt PASSWORD)\n" |
	\
		sudo tee -a /etc/squid/htpasswd


Note:   password will be truncated to 8 characters before encrypting!


Now restart the server:


	$ sudo systemctl squid restart


Go back and retest after adding the username and password to the
authentication part of the proxy settings.

		   HOW TO CREATE A SOCKS PROXY


A socks proxy example is much simpler.

Connect to the proxy server using the command:


	$ ssh squid@192.168.70.4 -D 40932

	...


The -D option means dynamic port forwarding and the port is specified
following the -D. In this case I will be opening up this port to
the SSH application so it will listen in to any incoming connections.

Lets go to Firefox to test out the socks proxy using a plugin called
FoxyProxy which allows me to only proxy the connection from my
Firefox browser. FoxyProxy -> Options. Give the proxy a name, type
= SOCKS5, IP address = 127.0.0.1, Port No = 40932.
