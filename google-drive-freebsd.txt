                ACCESSING GOOGLE DRIVE ON FREEBSD


GRIVE2


	# pkg install grive2
	# rehash


	$ grive 

This gives an error as we need to set it up


	$ mkdir ~/googledrive
	$ cd ~/googledrive

	$ grive -a 

Grive tells you to goto a url, authenticate yourself and then enter
the authentication code into grive.

Grive will now sync anything in ~/googledrive.

You can add any files you want to backup (preferably encrypted).
Then you must run 'grive' again manually.



OTHER OPTIONS

	- Rclone (my favourite)
	- Gnome's Nautilus has Google Drive built in - just add a
	  Google Account in the settings
	- InSync (not FOSS, paid)
	- OverGrive (grive with a gui)
