I have a large shell script that uses a mixture of spaces and tabs. I want to re-indent
the whole file based on syntax, like Eclipse's Format. Is there a program (beautify ?) that will do this ?

I'm having a hard time figuring out the logic with everything jammed together
e.g.

if [ "$CANCELLATION" ]
then
	while test $num -gt 0
	do
	if [ "$cjb" -gt 0 ]


Solution

	press Ctrl-space at the top of the file
	move the cursor to the bottom of the file
	press Alt-X and type untabify then return
	press Alt-X and type indent-region then return

This will get rid of tabs and indent everything properly.

If you need to do this more often and do not use Emacs as your
editor, you might want to pack it all into a script:

#!/usr/bin/emacs --script

(setq require-final-newline 'visit)

(defun indent-files (files)
	(cond (files
	(find-file (car files))
	(untabify (point-min) (point-max))
	(indent-region (point-min) (point-max))
	(save-buffer)
	(kill-buffer)
	(indent-files (cdr files)))))

(indent-files command-line-args-left)

;; EOF ;;
