FIREJAIL
========

See firejail.wordpress.com and github.com/retblue/firejail

Firejail is an SUID sandbox program that uses linux namespaces for 
process isolation. Written in C with virtually no dependancies.

$ firejail firefox
$ firejail transmission-gtk

$ sudo firejail /etc/init.d/nginx start

Firejail is restricted so that your filesystem is mounted READ-ONLY
by default (or even deny any access).

You can sandbox *ANY* type of process: servers, gui apps even an entire 
user login session.

$ sudo apt install firejail

Then configure the sandbox:

$ sudo firecfg

And then enable apparmor

$ sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/firejail-default

Then test

Run firefox with firejail and checkout to see if you can see /home/ian or /dev

Note how some things are restricted or missing (eg. .ssh or documents).

eg. Bash has network access and other processes denied by default.
So $ firejail bash cannot see the network.

$ firejail --net=none ping bbc.co.uk

If you have to use an unmaintained appimage:

$ firejail --net=none --appimage kdenlive.appimage
