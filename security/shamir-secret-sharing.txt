SHAMIR SEcret Sharing
=====================

Shamir secret sharing is a method of securely splitting up a secret
between several locations and recreating the secret from 'n' of the
'm' possible shares.


	secret -+------> share 1 ----------->  secret
	        |	                +--->
		+------> share 2 -------+
		|
		+------> share 3

With Shamir you only can find the secret key when you have the
required no of shares. Otherwise you have nothing!


KEYSAFE DEMO
------------

An experiment called KEYSAFE allowed you to securely backup a GPG
key (it currently appears to be closed)

The software is also in the Debian experiemental branch

GFSECRET application (in Debian)
================================

Gfsecret is a set of tools to facilitate secret sharing according
to the Adi Shamirâ€™s secret sharing scheme.

Two tools are provided: gfsec-split will split a file into several
shares, and gfsec-use will reconstruct the original file from some
of the shares.  Both tools use the concept of a share URI, which
is a way of describing a share with a URI-like syntax. The gfsec-split
program uses them to know where to dispatch the generated shares,
and gfsec-use uses them to know where to search for shares in order
to reconstruct the original file.

The package also provide a script wrapper around gfsec-split:
gfsec-split-gpg to facilitate splitting your GnuPG private primary
key which can be combine with gfsec-use.

For example:

	$ gfsec-split -n 2 \
		/home/alice/mysecret \
		file:///home/alice/.local/share/gfsecret/mysecret \
		label://USBSTICK/mysecret \
		mtp://RF2GB6X704P/Documents/mysecret

This will split the file /home/alice/mysecret into three shares:
one in Alice's home directory on the local filesystem, one on a USB
storage device with the label USBSTICK, and one on a MTP-compliant
device with the serial number RF2GB6X704P. Two shares will be needed
to reconstruct the original file, which means in this case that one
of the two removable devices will have to be present. (a MTP device
is a media transfer device, eg flash card, usb drive, harddrive, mp3
player etc).

SSSS application (in Debian & FreeBSD)
======================================
	
Implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. The program suite
does both: the generation of shares for a known secret, and the
reconstruction of a secret using user-provided shares.

Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme allows a secret to be split in to
shares.  These shares can then be distributed to different people.
When the time comes to retrieve the secret then a preset number of
the shares need to be combined.  The number of shares created, and
the number needed to retrieve the secret are set at splitting time.
The number of shares required to re-create the secret can be chosen
to be less that the number of shares created, so any large enough
subset of the shares can retrieve the secret.

This scheme allows a secret to be shared, either to reduce the
chances that the secret is lost, or to increase the number of parties
that must cooperate to reveal the secret.

The generation of shares given a known secret is shown first. A
(3,5)-threshold scheme is used, that is: 5 shares are generated,
the secret can be reconstructed by any subset of size 3.

	% ssss-split -t 3 -n 5
	Generating shares using a (3,5) scheme with dynamic security
	level.  Enter the secret, at most 128 ASCII characters: my
	secret root password

	Using a 184 bit security level.

	5-4756974923c0dce0a55f4774d09ca7a4865f64f56a4ee0


These shares can be combined to recreate the secret:

	% ssss-combine -t 3
	Enter 3 shares separated by newlines:
	Share [1/3]: 3-fa1c3a9c6df8af0779c36de6c33f6e36e989d0e0b91309
	Share [2/3]: 5-4756974923c0dce0a55f4774d09ca7a4865f64f56a4ee0
	Share [3/3]: 2-fbc74a03a50e14ab406c225afb5f45c40ae11976d2b665
	Resulting secret: my secret root password
