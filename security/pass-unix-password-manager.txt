PASS - THE STANDARD UNIX PASSWORD MANAGER
=========================================

https://passwordstore.org

With PASS, each password lives inside of a GPG encrypted file whose
filename is the title of the website or resource that requires the
password.

A password managed by PASS live in the directory ~/.password-store.

It is capable of temporarily putting passwords on the clipboard,
and also tracking password changes in git.

You can edit the password store using ordinary shell commands,
alongside the PASS command. There's even a bash-completion script
so that you can tab complete names and commands.

The community has also produced many good plugins for pass.

Pass can also re-encrypt for a new gpg key easily.

Setup is simple with:

	$ pass init "GPGKEYID"

You can use your standard key or one made especially for the password
store.

Mutiple keys can be specified for using pass in a team setting.

Different subfolders can have different GPG keys (specified using
the -p flag)

It can be managed with git:

	$ pass git init
	$ pass git remote add origin .........
