	  AN AUTHORATIVE DNS SERVER ON FREEBSD WITH BIND



Bind is probably the most used DNS server software in the world,
and it gives us loads of options.


	# pkg install git

	# git clone https://git.freebsd.org/ports.git /usr/ports

	# cd /usr/ports/dns/bind918


We could have also used the version installed in BASE in the base
system, but lets continue with ports ...


	# make install


We need to let the system know that we are using an installed version
of bind instead of the BASE version.


	# vi /etc/rc.conf

	named_enable="YES"
	named_flags="-4"
	named_program="/usr/local/sbin/named"
	named_conf="/usr/local/etc/namedb/named.conf"


This enabled the Bind daemon named and specifies which binary to use.


	# cd /usr/local/etc/named

	# vi named.conf


Change the version to none so it doesn't display our version number when queried.

We can change our forwarders to point to google for now.

And we will put in our master entry:


	zone "mydomain" {
		type master;
		file"/usr/local/etc/named/master/mydomain";
	};


We could also add a few defaults for logging if we want to.

We would also need to create the log files /var/log/query.log and /var/log/security/log and change the owndership from root:wheel to bind:bind. 

Finally we can startup bind:


	# /etc/rc.d/named start

	# tail -f /var/logl/query.log
