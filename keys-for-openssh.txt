There are a number of types of keys you can create and use in Open
SSH. Here we will look at the pros and cons of each of them.



                               RSA

	+ 	Tried and true
	-	Large keys
	=	Weak keys are easily broken

	Current NIST recommendation is 112 bit (2048 bit key length)
	but that will only last a few/couple of more years.

	NIST recommends 128 bit security going forward and to get
	that in RSA you need a key length of 3072 bits or larger.




                               DSA

	+	Adopted by FIPS-184 in 1994
	-       DSA supported in Putty, but OpenSSH 7.0 disables
		it by default preventing you from using DSA on Lnux
		machines.
	=       Requires the use of a randomly generated unpredictable
		and secret value, that if the seed is discovered
		can recreate the private key.

	DO NOT USE DSA!



                              ECDSA

	+       To achieve 128 bit security ECDSA only needs 256
		bit key lengths
	-       Hacked in Bitcoin and Sony Playstation 3
	=       ECDSA has known irregularities which cast suspicion
		on the algorithm

	DO NOT USE ECDSA *PERIOD*




                              EDDSA

	+       Not the same as ECDSA (with a C) and uses different
		algorithms
	- 	Relatively new
	=       None (yet), although it has been vetted a number
		of times




                    ED25519 (aka Curve 25519)

	+ 	Now available in crypto++ libraries
	+ 	Curve 25519 widely adopted
	+	Small key lengths making it fast yet more secure

	FIPS proposed ED448 in their recent draft of SP800-186




             BEFORE GENERATING KEYS ... THERE'S MORE


TL;DR	Where do you manage your keys?


With all that we talked about above, that is not the problem with
OpenSSH.

Where OpenSSH gets broken is through inappropriate configuration
or misconfiguration.


The real question is where do you manage your keys?




                           CONCLUSIONS

* 	RSA is tried and true but use a key length > 2048.

*       ED25519 is as secure but smaller and faster to use (although
	it is relatively new)

* 	DO NOT USE DSA or ECDSA!

*       Careful thought must be put into how you use and manage
	your keys

* 	And even more care taken when configuring systems.
