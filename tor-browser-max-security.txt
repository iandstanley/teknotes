		  TOR BROWSER MAX SECURITY SETUP




BEFORE WORKING ON TOR:


- don't use MS Windows with TOR. Windows logs all keystrokes and
  sends them to Microsoft. It has many bugs and faults. As revealed
  by NSA whilsteblower Edward Snowden, Microsoft actively works
  with the NSA and other USA/UK/non-US authorities who are part of
  the Fourteen Eyes.

- make sure everything is upto date especially TOR itself

- make sure your harddrive is encrypted (so people cannot access
  any leftover data from a TOR session).

- TOR should be separate from your actual identity - use only
  pseudonyms inside of TOR



MOVING TO THEIR (THE TOR PROJECT) LIST


- never torrent over the TOR network, as it slows down the entire
  network and is NOT SECURE for you either. Use a VPN for torrenting.

- don't enable or install browser plugins (that don't come as default
  ... only use NoSCript, HTTPS Everywhere, TorButton, TorLauncher).

- if possible, never download anything to your computer because you
  don't really know what is in the downloaded file.

- finally, use common sense: don't do anything that is illegal or
  that will get you into trouble. That's NOT what TOR was created
  for.



Lets look at the actual program:


- the first thing you should do is to click on the button to test
  network settings to ensure that you are being routed via the TOR
  network.

- next, click the Onion on the button bar and goto 'Security
  Settings', and set it to the most secure. This can slow down your
  browsing experience, but we are going for maximum security here.

- make sure your script blocker (NoScript) is fully enabled globally
  so scripts will be blocked on all websites. You should see the
  red symbol over the 'S'.


Next, lets go into some of the options.


Press the menu bar and then 'Settings':


- goto 'Search' and disable EVERYTHING except DuckDuckGo and StartPage
  and disconnect/remove other search engines

- under 'Content', popups should be disabled by default.

- under 'Privacy', check everything in 'Tracking', 'Never Remember
  History'

- in 'Security', enable everything in General and disable everything
  in 'Logins' You should AVOID logging into most, if not all accounts
  while using TOR.

- do not setup a Firefox account. And do not sync anything.

- in 'Advanced', under 'Update' enable automatic TOR updates.



Some more things:


- don't save any bookmarks. If you are using TAILS OS (or GNUPG/GPG
  manually) you are recommended to create a text file and encrypt
  the file if you need to write anything down.

- avoid saving pages from the browser

- never Maximize the TOR Browser. If you need more space it is
  recommended to manually drag the window corners to a larger size,
  BUT NEVER to cover the whole screen.


A controversial thing is whether to combine TOR with a VPN. If you
decide to use a VPN, make sure you use a VPN with a good security/privacy
profile (and not what they say in their advertising).
