                      PRINTING FORM FREEBSD



Printing from FreeBSD can seem daunting. Here we will show you both
the proper way to do it but also the quick and dirty way.


QUICK & DIRTY WAY

	# pkg install -y cups gutenprint

	# sysrc cupsd_enable="YES"

	# sysrc cups_browsed_enable="YES"

	# sysrc lpd_enable="YES"

	# service lpd start

	# service cupsd start

	# service cups_browsed start


	$ firefox locahost:631



We can then use the 'Administration' tab to add a printer (logging
in as root).

In our example we are using the Xerox B320 printer. We can the edit
the config file and #tag out the default JobPrivateAccess settings.


	<Policy default>
		# Job/subscription privacy .........
		# JobPrivateAccess default
		# JobPrivateValues default
		SubscriptionPrivateAccess default
		SubscriptionPrivateValues default
		JobPrivateAccess all
		JobPrivateValues none



	<Limit Create-job Print-job Print-URI Validate-Job>
		Order deny, allow
	</Limit>


To add a HP Jetdirect / Appsocketprinter:-


	[addprinter]
	choose Appsocket/HP JetDirect
	[continue]
	Connection = socket://192.168.1.174:9100
	[continue]

	Now name the printer

	Select make of printer - select [generic]
	Model = [generic IPP Eveywhere printer]
	(You can also upload a PPD file)



SETTING UP VIA USB


Select the local printer, (continue) then name it.

Google for a PPD file for your printer (eg Xerox B233 ppd)

Download the PPD. Unzip the download.

Typically you will get a Linux and Windows ppd files. 

We will want to select and use the Linux ppd driver.
