		      PREVENT IDENTITY THEFT



1.      Put a freeze on your credit

	There are a number of bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion
	to name the big three).

	By law these credit bureaus are required to provide the
	option and tools to freeze any and all requests for new
	credit issued.

	Don't fall for being sold a "CREDIT LOCK" or a "FRAUD ALERT":
	these are not the same. With both of these options these
	credit bureaus are allowed to sell your data to 3rd parties.

	Credit freeze hassles:

	- must be setup with EACH individual credit bureau

	- time consuming and bureau don't want to make it easy

	- requires you to unfreeze or "thaw" to use again requiring
	  a few extra hoops (1+ hours before any credit application).

	- you have to give over loads of information to identify
	  yourself

	- download your confirmation PDF and store securely
