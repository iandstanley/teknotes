		 AN INTRODUCTION TO FREEBSD JAILS



There is more than one way of doing this. Today we will use bsdinstall.
You can do it from source, from exjail, but bsdinstall is quick and
easy.


	# bsdinstall jail /usr/home/jails/www


Bsdinstall will pull the OS from FreeBSD's OS mirrors and install
to a directory that you specified on the command line.


	# ls /usr/home/jails

	  www


	# vi /etc/rc.conf

	  ifconfig_rc0_alias0="inet 10.148.86.198" jail_enable="YES"


	# vi /etc/jails.conf

	  www {

		host.hostname = www.home.local;

		ip4.addr = 10.148.86.198;

		path = "/usr/home/jails/www";

		#devfs_ruleset = "www_ruleset";

		mount.devfs;

		exec.start = "/bin/sh /etc/rc";

		exec.stop = "/bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown";

	}



This is the base minimum config we need. Once we've got this we can
start it.


	# service jail start www

	# jls

	  JID   IP Address      Hostname         Path

	  2     10.148.86.198   www.home.local   /usr/home/jails/www


So how do I get into my jail?


	# jexec  2  csh

	root@www:/#


Here we remotely execute csh on jail "2" (you can use the jail name
instead if you wish).


	root@www:/#  uname -a FreeBSD www.home.local ...


We can install software inside the jail:


	root@www:/  pkg install pico-alpine


So what can we do with a jail. Well pretty much anything you can
do on a slot.

e.g. with our www jail:


	# jexec www csh

	root@www:/# vi /etc/rc.conf

	  sshd_enable = "YES"

	#root@www:/ pkg install nginx php80 php80-extensions

You can also install the package inside the jail from outside the
jail with 'pkg --jail <jail name or ID> ...'
