	   FREEBSD: GETTING YOUR X GRAPHICS AND CONSOLE
		    RESOLUTION WORKING QUICKLY



One of the things you will notice, especially on the X1 Carbon or
newer laptops is that the resolution is insanely high when you first
install, the console is so small you can't even read it.

You'll want to install your graphics driver 'drm-current' (or the
less bleeding edge 'drm-fbsd'nn).


	# pkg install drm-current

	# vi /etc/rc.conf

	  kld_list "/boot/modules/i915kms.ko cuse"


Here we tell the boot loader to load the i915 kms kernel module
(for X1 Carbon graphics Intel board), plus any other kernel modules.


	# vi /boot/loader.conf

	  kern.vt.fb.default_mode="1280x720"

	  # ThinkPad

	  acpi_video_load = "YES"

	  acpi_ibm_load = "YES"

	  # DRM

	  drm.i915.enable_rcb=7

	  drm.i915.semaphore="1"

	  drm.i915.enable_fbc="1"


What I normally do is goto a 'Resolution Scale Calculator'. For
example:


	https://bneijt.nl/pr/resolution-scale-calculator


And enter the display resolution: for the X1 Carbon it is 2560x1440.
It will then give you a list of scalings and I drop back one ot two
levels to 1280x720.

Then go to /boot/loader.conf and add the following line:


	kern.vt.fb.default_mode="1280x720"


You boot, and the module is reloaded we will see the resolution change to the specified 1280x720.


	# vi /usr/local/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf
