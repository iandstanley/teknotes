# mailx – Send automated Linux email with gmail

When something on my Linux servers needs to send email (WordPress, 
Nagios, cron scripts, etc), I use mailx. With the spam filters everyone 
has a lot of my automated emails haven’t been reaching their 
destination. I’ve done the SPF rules and making sure my forward matches 
my reverse DNS lookups; even have done DKIM. Can’t seem to find a 
reliable option with sending email from the command line without it 
getting flagged for spam.

The fix was for me to use mailx with a gmail Account profile. This way 
any email sent from the system will get sent through the gmail servers. 
Since I host my email domain with GSuite, this was an easy win. I simply 
made a noreply mailbox, setup 2 factor authentication on it and then 
used a password for less secure apps. The rest is pretty simple!

## Install mailx

I’m performing this install on Ubuntu 16.04

	sudo apt-get install heirloom-mailx

Create the gmail account for mailx

Add the following information into ~/.mailrc with nano ~/.mailrc

	account gmail {
	    set smtp-use-starttls
	    set ssl-verify=ignore
	    set smtp-auth=login
	    set smtp=smtp://smtp.gmail.com:587
	    set from="noreply@yourdomain.com(Your Real Name)"
	    set smtp-auth-user=noreply@yourdomain.com
	    set smtp-auth-password=your_less_secure_apps_password
	    set ssl-verify=ignore
	}

Change the settings above to match your requirements. Save and send 
yourself a test message with:

	echo -e "Mail body text" | mailx -A gmail -s "Mail subject" your@email

You should receive your email soon from your gmail account!

For automated system-wide emails to be sent correctly you need to login 
as root. You can sudo su to get access as root and then repeat this 
process.

This has helped keep my automated emails from being flagged as spam. 
Hope this helps you too!
