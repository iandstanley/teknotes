                  ADD FREEBSD TO A WIFI NETWORK




List your network devices:


	# ifconfig


This will show you any wired ethernet connections, and the loopback lo0. But often we don't see the wifi card listed.

Look at the system messages:


	# dmesg | more


For example, this shows that the Os detected a wifi card eg bwn_pci0 a Broadcom BCM43224 wifi card.


	# vi  /etc/rc.conf

	wlans_bwn0="wlan0"

	ifconfig_wlan0="WPA DHCP"


This tells us that we want to use the WPA key and get a DHCP address.

The next thing we want to do is create the interface:


	# ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev bwn0


If we now run 'ifconfig' we can now see my wifi card, we can see it's MAC address and a status of 'no carrier'. No carrier means that it hasn't got an IP adress and is not connected.

So to connect:


	# vi  /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

	network = { 
		ssid="my_network_ssid"
		psk="my_preshared_key"
	}


To create this we can do:


	# wpa_passphrase <myssid> <mypsk> >> /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf


Finally, we can restart our network:


	# service netif restart
