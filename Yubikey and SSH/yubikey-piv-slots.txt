YUBIKEY PIV SLOTS
=================

A PIV enabled Yubikey NEO holds 4 distinct slots for certificates
and a Yubikey 4 or 5 holds 24.  Each of these slots is acapable of
holding an X509 certificate together with it's accompanying private
key.

The PIN policy for these slots described here are based upon the
PIV standards (This can be changed on the Yubikey 4 & 5).

		PIN. This PIN must be used every time.
