MULTIPLE SSH KEYS
=================

You may need to have multiple ssh keys forsome reason. Maybe you
are required to by work or by some seperation of concerns for
security resaons.

Say you already have a SSH key and want to add a second specifically
for github.com.

	$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
		-C "github ssh key" 
		-f ~/.ssh/github.key

	$ ls ~/.ssh

		shows github.key and github.key.pub amoungst others

	$ vi ~/.ssh/config

	Add the following lines:

		Host github.com
		IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github.key
		User git
