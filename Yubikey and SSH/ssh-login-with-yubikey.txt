SSH LOGIN WITH YUBIKEY ======================

PREREQUISITES

# apt install libpam_yubico

This creates the library /lib/security/pam_yubico.so


CONFIGURING FILES

# vi /etc/ssh/authorised_yubikeys

	<username>:  <yubicoid>

Where 'yubicoid' is the first 12 characters from the Yubico OTP
output.  

eg.
	ryan: vvrelbuvjnir


# vi /etc/pam.d/sshd

	auth required pam_yubico.so id=clientid \
		key=secret authfile=/etc/ssh/authorised_yubikey


Where 'clientid' and 'secret' are obtained from Yubico. You will
need to sign up for an API key to set these up.

# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

	ChallengeResponseAuthentication  yes 
	UsePAM  yes

# systemctl  restart  sshd

You could also use sufficient instead of required if you don't want
pam to check any more authorisation steps.
