SIMPLE SSH HONEYPOT
===================

You can use fail2ban to prevent brute forcing of accounts. But
sometimes you want to punish those who attempt this and waste their
time. This is the idea of a honeypot.

The SSH protocol specification allows for a banner which is displayed
to everyone who tries to connect to the ssh port.

There is NO LIMIT to how long a banner can be OR how much time it
can take to display.

A guy called Chris Wellons took this idea and developed a piece of
software that he called ENDLESS SSH.

With Endless SSH you put your real ssh server on a different port
and run endless-ssh on port 22.

Everytime somebody tries to log into your server on port 22 they
will be forced to read a very, very long text message that will
never timeout or give an error message. This can lock up an attacker
for hours or even days.

For full details see github.com/skeeto/endlessh


	$ git clone https://github.com/skeeto/endlessh

	$ cd endlessh && make

Debian based systems may need to install libc6-dev.

Now put the binary into the path and install the service file.

	# sudo cp util/endlessh.service /etc/systemd/system.conf

Or you can use 'make install'.

	# systemctl enable endlessh
	# mkdir /etc/endlessh
	# vim /etc/endlessh/config

		Port 22
	# systemctl restart endlessh

Check it is running

	$ netstat -tulpn | grep endlessh
