If you are using SSH with Smart Card (PIV), and adding the card to ssh-agent with
ssh-add -s /usr/lib64/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.so
you may get the error
sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed: agent refused operation
from ssh if the PIV authentication has expired, or if you have removed and reinserted the PIV card.

In that case, if you try to do another ssh-add -s you will still get an error:
Could not add card "/usr/lib64/opensc-pkcs11.so": agent refused operation

According to RedHat Bug 1609055 - pkcs11 support in agent is clunky, you instead need to do

ssh-add -e /usr/lib64/opensc-pkcs11.so
ssh-add -s /usr/lib64/opensc-pkcs11.so
