# Yubikey 5 NFC not working with yubioath-desktop, py-yubikey-manager and py-yubikey-manage-qt


Hello all, my yubikey 5 NFC is not detected by 
security/ypy-yubikey-manager (CLI) and security/yubikey-manager-qt (GUI) 
on my FreeBSD 12.1. ykman-gui and ykman list does not detect my yubikey! 
Code:

	$ ykman list
	Usage: ykman list [OPTIONS]
	Try "ykman list -h" for help

	Error: Failed to establish CCID context. Is the pcscd service running?


My YubiKey 5 NFC is not recognized by security/yubioath-desktop (yubykey 
authenticator) too.

I read "Connecting to Yubikey..." on the yubykey authenticator window 
when my yubikey 5 NFC to USB port is connected to USB port. I read "No 
YubiKey detected" when is NOT connected. Maybe because yubioath-desktop 
is not updated to at least version 5.0.3. 

Code:
	
	Version 5.0.3 (released 2020-04-14)
    macOS: Make the app available in the macOS App Store
    Windows: Make the app available in the Microsoft Store (for Windows 10 20.04 and higher)
    Linux: Make the app available in the Snap Store
    Add support for YubiKey 5C NFC
    Bugfix: Make sure the application is always visible on Windows


I get right output using ykinfo -s -m -H -v -t -p and gpg --card-status. 
It seems my yubikey is correctly recognized by FreeBSD but not by 
py-yubikey-manager-qt and yubioath-desktop Code:

	$ dmesg
	ugen2.2: <Yubico YubiKey OTP+FIDO+CCID> at usbus2
	ukbd2 on uhub2
	ukbd2: <Yubico YubiKey OTP+FIDO+CCID, class 0/0, rev 2.00/5.27, addr 2> on usbus2


What is wrong?


It seems you need to set pcscd to run.

In order to keep pcscd run on start, 

	# sysrc pcscd_enable=yes 

should do the trick (you would need to reload rc.conf by simply 
rebooting). I have encountered the issue, and confirmed it worked.

also don't forget to install pcsc-tools!
