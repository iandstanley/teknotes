HOW TO USE YUBIKEY WITH OPENSSH 8,2+
====================================

In this article we will be using a Yubikey 4 for FIDO u2f authentication.
But this process can also be used with later Yubikeys in the Yubikey
5 series (inlcuding the Yubikey 5 blue Security Key which has SSH
key support for 'ECDSA-SK' keys).

For FIDO2 authentication you will need OpenSSH >= 8.2. To verify
that you have a supported version of OpenSSH:

$ ssh -V

Now generate a ECDSA-SK -or- ED25519-SK keypair (the SK stands for
'security key' ie hardware).

Note ED25519-SK is only supported by Yubikeys with firmware 5.2.3+
and are limited to the Yubikey 5 series or later.

$ lsusb -v 2>/dev/null | grep -Az Yubico | grep "bcdDevice" \
	awk '{print $2}'

You will be able to see the firmware version for the Yubikey. 

A Yubikey 4 may have a firmware version of 4.37 so we will have to
use the ECDSA-SK key type rather than the ED25519-SK type. Some
have claimed that the ECDSA-SK has a NSA backdoor, so you will need
to use a newer Yubikey.

See tinyurl/yk-nsa-backdoor

$ ssh-keygen  -t ecdsa-sk  -f ~/.ssh/testkey
  Generating public/private ecdsa-sk key pair.  
  You may need to touch your authenticator.

  Enter passphrase:  ____________________
$

Copy over your public key 

$ ssh-copyid -i ~/.ssh/testkey.pub user@servername

And test it:

$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/testkey user@servername
  Confirm prescence for key ECDSA-SK
