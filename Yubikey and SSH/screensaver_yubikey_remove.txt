# enable / disable xscreensaver with an insert / remove of a yubikey

Sup all,

as the title states, this article will go over how to automatically
enable / disable xscreensaver on the insertion / removal of your
yubikey. only caveat is that it will not lock the screen. this
article assumes that your xscreensaver session will lock the screen
after x amount of minutes (preferably < 5 minutes).

## Udev

i added these lines to file /etc/udev/rules.d/90-yubico-u2f.rules:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="remove", ENV{ID_VENDOR_ID}=="XXXX", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}="XXXX", RUN+="/usr/local/bin/yubikey_ss.sh enable"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ENV{ID_VENDOR_ID}=="XXXX", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}=="XXXX", RUN+="/usr/local/bin/yubikey_ss.sh disable"

for those lines to work we need to insert the yubikey and run

	udevadm monitor --udev --property

and grep both “ID_VENDOR_ID” and “ID_MODEL_ID” and replace the XXXX
with the corresponding greps.

then restart udev once the script is in place

	yubikey_ss.sh

next we will add /usr/local/bin/yubikey_ss.sh with these contents:

	#!/usr/bin/env bash

	_USER=$(ps -aux \
	    | awk '$0 !~ /root/ && /session/ {print $1}' \
	    | sed -n '1p')

	case "$1" in
	    enable)
		/bin/su ${_USER} \
		    -c "DISPLAY=:0 /usr/bin/xscreensaver-command -activate"
		;;
	    disable)
		/bin/su ${_USER} \
		    -c "DISPLAY=:0 /usr/bin/xscreensaver-command -deactivate"
		;;
	esac

and make it executable.

test to ensure that it works.

Notes

at this point, you should realize that you are just activating the
screensaver and not locking it so the password will not be on unless
you have the “Lock screen after” option enabled in

	xscreensaver-command -demo

set it to around 5 or less minutes. one if you are paranoid.
