FIDO2 & Openssh 8.2
===================

With Openssh 8.2 we now gain support for using FIDO2 keys for
authentication.

To do this we need to generate an security key (type = ECDSA-SK,
nb the -SK is for a security key).

	$ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -f .ssh/fidokey

This will generate a public/private key pair on the FIDO2 key (eg.
Yubikey Blue security key).


You may need to touch your fido2 authenticator to confirm user
prescence and authorise key generation.

	(press key)

	Enter passphrase:

	Your identification has been saved in .ssh/fidokey

	Your public keyhas been saved in .ssh/fidokey.pub

	The key fingerprint is

	SHA256: ???????????????????????????????????????????


Now add the ssh public key to your authorised_keys file:

	$ cat .ssh/fidokey.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys 

and test:

	$ ssh -i .ssh/fidokey localhost


If this is all working properly you may wish to configure your
.ssh/config for the hosts you want to use this key

	$ vi .ssh/config

		Host localhost
		IdentityFile ~/.ssh/fidokey.key

NB not all FIDO2 keys support this feature. All Yubikey series 5
keys including the Blue Security key does.
