QUICK & DIRTY HTTPS WEBSERVER USING OPENSSL
===========================================

1. Create SSL Certificate

	$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 
		-keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
		-days 365 -nodes

2. Open a port on the firewall (if needed)

3. Let's run an SSL webserver on port 44330, say

	$ openssl s_server -key key.pem -cert cert.pem \
		-accept 44330 -WWW


QUICK & DIRTY HTTP WEBSERVER USING PHP
======================================

Often you don't need the overhead of HTTP for development work. 

You can get awau with a simple HTTP server instead. Many people
install a dedicated webserver or write their own. But why go the
effort when many machines have PHP installed by default.

If you have PHP vesion 5.4+ (use 'php -v' to check; the current
Debian 10 version is v7.3) then you can run a simple PHP based
webserver that canserve simple PHP sites and static HTML sites.

Simply run:

	$ php -S 127.0.0.1:8080

You could also run a stunnelwrapper for SSL if needed 

	$ stunnel -d 443 -r 8080

The server will serve index.html or index.php to your browser on
the localhost URL.


WHAT NO PHP? GOT PYTHON? WELL...
================================

	$ python -m http.server
