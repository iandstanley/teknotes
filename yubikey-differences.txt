             FEATURES OF THE VARIOUS RECENT YUBIKEYS


Although the Yubikey 5 Series are the currently available product
available for sale via many vendors, sellers on eBay are regularly
selling older versions of te Yubikey (mainly the Yubikey 4 Series
and the Yubikey Neo).

As Yubico released a new version they added various features. NB
The Yubikey NEO and the Yubikey 4 were released at around the same
time providing different sets of features. The Yubikey 5 Series
combined the features of the NEO and the Yubikey 4 as well as adding
a few improvements to encryption algorithms.

The Yubikey 4 and NEO devices are no longer for sale except on eBay.
Sellers on eBay have old stock of NEW Yubikey 4 devices and companies
or individuals sell used versions of the Yubikey 4 series.  Yubikey
NEO devices are rarer as they sold less than the 4 series, but you
will still see them regularly sold as used on eBay (and very
occaisionally a new NEO).

Buying a used Yubikey is perfectly safe as you can easily delete
any previous credentials with the tools Yubico provides; most sellers
on eBay will remove any credentials on the Yubikey before selling
them.  However, you should understand the security features you
need before choosing a Yubikey as the features differ from device
to device.

                           YUBIKEY NEO


The Yubikey NEO was released as an 'upgrade' to the Yubikey 4 feature
set by adding the facility to use NFC (near field communication)
allowing the user to use the key with their mobile phone, tablet
or other NFC enabled devices. Note the Yubikey 4, although considered
lower in the range does support Ecliptic Curve algorithms like
ECC-P256 and ECC-P384 in the PIV applet and RSA with 3072/4096 bits
in the OpenPGP applet.

The Yubikey NEO is a device in for the form of a USB-A device. It
supprots NFC connectivity with phones etc. Also there was a nano
versio of the Yubikey NEO called the 'NEO-n', although they are not
available even in the secondhand market. The NEO-n does not support
NFC so really is a downgrade compared to the 'Yubikey 4 Nano' as
it doesn't add any features and also misses out on the Yubikey 4
series additions.

                         YUBIKEY 4 SERIES


The Yubikey 4 series comes in a range of formats. The regular USB-A
device known as the 'Yubikey 4'. Also available is a USB-C device
called the 'Yubikey 4c'. Finally, there is another kind of USB-A
device designed to be inserted into a USB-A port on a semi-permanent
basis (it can be removed with a fingernail or a paperclip). All
three formats have the same feature set.

	Yubikey also created a series of Yubikeys that where also
	FIPS certified (certified against the FIPS standard required
	by the US Government). All members of the Yubikey 4 Series
	(but not the NEO) are availale in the same form factors and
	features


	--------------------------------------------------------------


                         YUBIKEY 5 SERIES


The Yubikey 5 Series was designed to simplify the options created
by the Yubikey 4 Series and NEO series by creating a single key
with ALL of the features of the 4 and NEO devices with updated
cryptography.

The Yubikey 5 Series range consists of the following:

	- Yubikey 5 NFC
	- Yubikey 5c NFC
	- Yubikey 5c 
	- Yubikey 5 Nano
	- Yubikey 5c Nano
	- Yubikey 5Ci

There are a few differences between models. The Nano versions
together with the 'Yubikey 5c' and 'Yubikey 5Ci' devices do NOT
support NFC due to the physical constraints on these devices.

Also in the range is the Yubikey 5 Security key available in USB-A
and USB-C formats. In previous generations the Security key was a
separate range. In the latest series the security key is considered
part of the range. To simplify the discussion I have left the
security keys for the next section of this document as their
functionality is radically different to the regular Yubikeys.

			FIPS Certification

	The Yubikey Series 5 keys are available in a FIPS certified
	version in all form factors except the BIO series.


	--------------------------------------------------------------


                        YUBIKEY BIO SERIES


In 2021 Yubikey announced two new devices in the Yubikey 5NFC and
Yubikey 5C NFC form factors with the addition of a fingerprint
sensor replacing the yellow button. At the time of writing this
technical note not all services have upgraded their code to support
the fingerprint version.

The BIO series are different from the Yubikeys above as they are
only U2F/FIDO2 compatible and are essentially a Yubikey 5 Security
Key with a fingerprint reader.

You must register your fingerprints on the device before you can
use it as a U2F or FIDO2 key.

They are available with either a USB-A or a USB-C connector and do
not suport NFC.


The BIO keys only have a single applet supporting U2F(FIDO1) and
FIDO2 protocols.

* U2F aka FIDO (v.1) (USB/FIDO)

	Unlimited no of u2f credentials and if FIDO certified

* FIDO2 (USB/FIDO)

	This is an upgrade to the U2F applet supporting both U2F
	and FIDO2.

	Can offer truely passwordless authentication with WebAuthn
	enabled websites

	Can hold upto 25 resident keys which can be left unlocked
	but protected by a PIN number (of 4-63 characters). If PIN
	is entered wrong 8 times in a row the FIDO2 app is locked.

	FIDO2 in most current use cases is identical to the user
	to U2F/FIDO v.1


	--------------------------------------------------------------


                      YUBIKEY SECURITY KEYS


The Yubikey Security Keys are made out of a blue plastic to denote
that they are different to the almost identical Yubikey. 

The Yubico Security keys are designed for a different purpose than
the keys mentioned above (NB the Yubikey BIO series are essentially
a Yubikey 5 Security Key with a fingerprint reader).

The purpose the Yubikey Security keys were designed to use with
second factor authentication on the Web. Modern browsers have
functionality written into them to support WebAuthn/U2F/FIDO2
protocols allowing the webpage to authenticate with the Yubikey.

In recent months Yubikey has updated the firmware on the Yubikey 5
Security Key (FIDO2 compliant version) to also support SSH keys.


	--------------------------------------------------------------


                    PURCHASING A SECURITY KEY


There are FOUR different versions of the Yubico security key that
all look similar but have different functionalities. Care should
be taken in identifying that you are buying the correct key before
purchase.

The original security key (FIDO U2F Security Key) only supported
U2F and had a gold button with a key symbol on it. This device does
NOT support NFC and therefore has no radio wave symbols on the
button.

The next version, simply known as the 'Yubico Security Key' is
identical to the first version but has the number 2 etched in the
blue plastic above the button. This key added FIDO2 support (see
below).

The remaining two versions are essentially the same key but in USB-A
and USB-C connection formats. Both support NFC connectivity. These
Yubikey Security Keys have a gold button with two NFC wave symbols
surrounding the Key symbol (the same button design as the Yubikey
5 NFC).

In a recent blog article in late 2021 Yubico announced SSH support
using the FIDO2 resident credentials for new security keys sporting
the latest firmware release (requires OpenSSH version8.2+ on client
and server).

	--------------------------------------------------------------


                       YUBIKEY FIDO U2F SECURITY KEY


This original Yubikey Security Key only supported U2F and was
designed and priced to provide second factor web authentication at
a substantial discount over the regular Yubikeys.

This original security key does not support the NFC protocol and
only came in USB-A connections.

It supports only the U2F (FIDO v.1):

* U2F aka FIDO (v.1) (USB/FIDO)

	- Unlimited no of u2f credentials and if FIDO certified

It can easily be identified from other Yubico security keys as the
gold button has only a key symbol.


	--------------------------------------------------------------


		       YUBIKEY SECURITY KEY (2nd gen)


This is an upgrade to the original security key (the 'FIDO U2F
Security Key') adding support for FIDO2 resident credentials.

This security key only supported U2F and FIDO2 and was designed and
priced to provide second factor web authentication at a substantial
discount over the regular Yubikeys.

This security key still does not support the NFC protocol and only
came in USB-A connections.

It supports only the U2F (FIDO v.1) and the FIDO2 standards:

* U2F aka FIDO (v.1) (USB/FIDO)

	- Unlimited no of u2f credentials and if FIDO certified

* FIDO2 (USB/FIDO)

	This is an upgrade to the U2F applet supporting both U2F
	and FIDO2.

	Can offer truely passwordless authentication with WebAuthn
	enabled websites

	Can hold upto 25 resident keys which can be left unlocked
	but protected by a PIN number (of 4-63 characters). If PIN
	is entered wrong 8 times in a row the FIDO2 app is locked.

	FIDO2 in most current use cases is identical to the user
	to U2F/FIDO v.1


It can easily be identified from other Yubico security keys as the
gold button has only a key symbol without any NFC radio waves on
it. It differentiates itself from the original security key by
advertising it's FIDO2 support with an etched '2' above the gold
key button.

	--------------------------------------------------------------


          YUBIKEY SECURITY NFC KEY  & SECURITY KEY C NFC
                            (3rd gen)


This Yubikey Security Key was designed and priced to provide second
factor web authentication for both computers and also mobile devices
that have an NFC chip in them.

This new security key, often associated with the Yubikey 5 Series
(and sometimes called the Yubikey 5 Security Key) comes in both
USB-A and USB-C formats.

The versions are essentially the same key but in USB-A and USB-C
connection formats. Both support NFC connectivity. These Yubikey
Security Keys have a gold button with two NFC wave symbols surrounding
the Key symbol (the same button design as the Yubikey 5 NFC).

In a recent blog article in late 2021 Yubico announced SSH support
using the FIDO2 resident credentials for new security keys sporting
the latest firmware release (requires OpenSSH version8.2+ on client
and server).

It supports both U2F and FIDO2 standards:

* U2F aka FIDO (v.1) (USB/FIDO)

	Unlimited no of u2f credentials and if FIDO certified

* FIDO2 (USB/FIDO)

	This is an upgrade to the U2F applet supporting both U2F
	and FIDO2.

	Can offer truely passwordless authentication with WebAuthn
	enabled websites

	Can hold upto 25 resident keys which can be left unlocked
	but protected by a PIN number (of 4-63 characters). If PIN
	is entered wrong 8 times in a row the FIDO2 app is locked.

	FIDO2 in most current use cases is identical to the user
	to U2F/FIDO v.1

* SSH support

	This latest version of the security key can use a FIDO2
	resident slot to provide support for an SSH key.



	--------------------------------------------------------------


                         LEGACY YUBIKEYS


There are a few legacy devices that are generally no longer available
(even on the secondhand market like eBay). They include:

They have their uses still today particularly those supporting the
U2F applet (NEO and Edge in both regular key and Nano formats). But
often the second hand price for these are inflated and you are
better off getting a NEO or a Yubikey 4 series than purchase these.

I have a Yubikey Standard (Yubikey 2) that I only use for holding
the router passwords using the OTP applet (with a static password).
But for most use cases the Yubikey Standard and it's nano format
sister device the Yubikey Nano have limited use cases for most
users.

If you are a technical user however, experienced in managing a Linux
or BSD machine, you can use the OTP applet to add second factor
authentication to a home server (using Yubico OTP, Challenge-Response,
HMAC-SHA1 or OATH-HOTP). Note that the OATH-TOTP was introduced in
the NEO series and was not available on the older devices.

Occaisionally Available on eBay:

	- Yubikey NEO (see above, still available occaisionally on
	  eBay)
	- Yubikey Standard (aka Yubikey 2a, only supports the OTP
	  applet). The Yubikey Standard is identified by a dot on
	  the button.

Haven't seen these available anywhere for a few years:

	- Yubikey Nano (like the Yubikey 4 Nano, but only supports
	  the OTP applet)
	- Yubikey Neo-n (a NEO in Nano format without NFC support) 
	- Yubikey Edge (An upgrade to the Yubikey Standard adding
	  U2F support)
	- Yubikey Edge-n (A Yubikey Edge in Nano format)
