The GNUPG tool has a command to backup keys to a card.



	$ gpg

	gpg> help


Here we see the command backup to card "bkuptocard <file>".

The bkuptocard command takes a filename as a parameter. The filename is a file which has been created using the options:

		--export-options backup


This backup format includes all data required to restore the key(s) later with gpg.
