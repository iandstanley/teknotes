                        CHROOTS ON DEBIAN




	# apt install -y binutils debootstrap

	# mkdir -p /chroot/stretch

	# debootstrap --arch i386 stretch /chroot/stretch \
		https://deb.debian.org/debian

	# chroot /chroot/stretch


A more convienient way to enter a chroot is provided by the 'schroot'
package.

The  'schroot' wrapper allows unprivileged users to have access to
one or more chroot(2) environments.

Schroot handles the chroot(2) call as well as dropping privileges
inside the chroot(2), setting up /etc/resolv.conf and bind mounting
resources into the chroot (like home directories, /dev, /sys, /proc).




			  CONFIGURATION


In general, it is necessary to create/edit key configuration points.

Create a /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d file IN THE CHROOT so that dpkg
won't start daemons unless desired.

This example prevents all daemons from being started in the chroot.


	# chroot /chroot/stretch

	# cat  > ./usr/sbin/policy-rc.d

	#!/bin/sh

	exit 101

	EOF

	# chmod a+x ./usr/sbin/policy-rc.d

	# chroot /chroot/stretch

	# dpkg-install 	--direct /usr/bin/ischroot.debianutils \
			--rename /usr/bin/ischroot

	# ln -s /bin/true /usr/bin/ischroot


According to an old 2012 post:

	NOTE: The 'ischroot' command is buggy and doesn't detect
	that it is running in a chroot. Several packages depend
	upon ischroot for determining correct behaviour. An easy
	fix for this is to replace ischroot with /bin/true.


To edit the bash prompt, add an identifier to /etc/debian-chroot
and the contents get added to $PS1.

Mount filesystems from the underlying host (NOT in the chroot).




                   MOUNTING PSEUDO FILESYSTEMS


/proc           check the chrooted system the prescence of /procif
		the chroot is not likely to be fully operational.
		A priori, since version Debian/Wheezy debootstrap
		integrates natively mount /proc and /sys

		proc on /proc type proc (rw)
		sysfs on /sys type sysfs bind (rw)


/dev/pts        It is also advisable to do a 'bind' /dev/pts to
		prevent error messages like "Must be connected to
		a terminal" or "Can not access /dev/pts/0 No such
		file or directory" with using the control screen

		# mount --bind /dev/pts /chroot/stretch/dev/pts




                    ADDING / REMOVING PACKAGES


Eliminate unnecessary packages.

	# apt install  deborphan
	# deborphan -a
	# apt remove --purge telnet pppconfig ipchains .......




                              USAGE


Common examples of chroot usage:

* recompiling application in a context other than the machine that
  hosts the chroot (backport, cross-compiling ...)

* update service production by tilting the old service (host machine)
  to the new (installed in the chroot)

* securing a service "chrooted" from the host machine (and vice
  versa)
