	USING GROFF WITH PANDOC TO CONVERT MARKDOWN TO PDF



Pretty much everything you can do in Pandoc normally, actually works
properly with groff.

One major issue is that you have to convert images into .eps format
for them to work.

Headings, bullets, images (via eps), pagebreaks, tables, even Math
using LaTeX works. You can also use groff features eg. write equations
in 'eqn', or complex tables in 'tbl' inside the markdown file.

You can convert image files using ImageMajick:

	$ convert orig.png new.eps

The LaTeX math appears inside $$ dollar signs:

	$\neg$(p$\lor$q) ....

	$leftrightarrow$ ($\neg$p)

	$\land$ ($\neg$q)

This allows you to do LaTeX math inside the file without installing
LaTeX:

	$ pandoc temp.md -t ms -o temp.pdf

Or inside the file:

	```(=ms)
	.NH
	This is a ms heading
	```

This allows you to do some pretty cool things. Fro example at the
top of the file you can add:

	```(=ms)
	.TL
	This is a title

	```

We can also add tables:

	```(=ms)
	.TS 
	centre allbox tab(1);
	ccc.
	header
	this | is a | table
	.TE
	```

You can also do PIC drawings in the Pandoc markdown file:

	```(=ms)
	.PS 
	box
	.PE
	```

But we must pass a -p option:

	$ pandoc temp.md -t ms --pdf-engine-opt=-p -o temp.pdf
