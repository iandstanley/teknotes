# Microsoft Surface Go Linux Instructions

These instructions are for setting up Endeavour OS on Surface Go. While you can stick with default Xfce desktop, I suggest installing Gnome desktop for better touchscreen experience once Endeavour is installed.

## What You Need

Surface Go Tablet
USB C to USB A Adapter
USB Stick
USB Ethernet Dongle
Turn off Secure Boot Access Surface Pro BIOS

## Make sure the Surface Pro device is turned off.
Hold the volume-up button.
Press and release the power button.
When the Surface logo appears, release the volume-up button.
The Surface UEFI firmware interface screen will be displayed and you can make changes.
Turn off secure boot

## Installation

Download Endeavour OS and burn it to USB drive
Use the USB C to USB adapter to plug-in the USB drive
Install Endeavour OS
Update pacman -Syuu

## Get WiFi To Work

Download this file to your Downloads folder: http://www.killernetworking.com/support/K1535_Debian/board.bin
sudo rm /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1/board.bin
sudo cp ~/Downloads/board.bin /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1
sudo rm /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/board.bin
sudo cp ~/Downloads/board.bin /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0
restart

## Setup Auto-rotate Screen

trizen -S iio-sensor-proxy-git
trizen -S screenrotator-git
trizen -Ss arch-linux-surface
pacman -Ss arch-linux-surface

## Install Gnome

sudo pacman -S Gnome
sudo pacman -S chrome-gnome-shell

## Keyboard
Settings > Devices > Turn On-screen Keyboard on or Off > Shift + Super + K

## Mouse

Settings > Mouse & Touchpad > Tap To Click
Enable Bluetooth

Install blueman
Install bluez-utils
systemctl enable bluetooth.service
systemctl start bluetooth.service

## Enable Touchscreen Gestures In Firefox

Make sure dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled is either set to 1 (enabled) or 2 (default, auto-detect).
Add MOZ_USE_XINPUT2 DEFAULT=1 to /etc/security/pam_env.conf and then logout or reboot your system for the changes to take effect.
Firefox toolbar

In a new tab, type or paste about:config in the address bar and press Enter. Click the button accepting the risk.
In the filter box, type or paste ‘devp’ and pause while the list is filtered
Double-click layout.css.devPixelsPerPx and change its value to 1.5 and click OK. That corresponds to 150% of the classic font size.
Too big? Try 1.25
Too small? Try 2.0

## Display

Set Scale 200%
Install Steam For Gaming

flatpak install steam

## What Doesn’t Work

Camera’s do not function but this is not critical for me but might be for some.
On-screen keyboard works but doesn’t feel as well integrated as other tablets like an iPAD. With that being said Surface is really ideal with the keyboard case.
