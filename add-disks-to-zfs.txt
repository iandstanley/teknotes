     ADDING DISKS TO FREEBSD AND SETTING THEM UP WITH ZFS NEW



After you have physically installed your new drive(s) into your computer and booted it.


	% cd /dev


You will see da0, da1 and da2 for example. The disk da0 was our boot disk and the two disks we have installed are da1 and da2.


	% su -


And show your zpool:


	# zpool list


We see the default pool 'zroot'.

We need to create a new zpool. We need to decide what kind of zpool we want: a stripe, a mirror or a raidz.

In a stripe the mimimum amount of disks we need is 1, and in a mirror we need 2 or more disks.


	# zpool create media mirror /dev/da1 /dev/da2


Here 'media' is the name of our pool.


	# zpool list


This now shows us 2 pools, zroot and media.


	# zpool status


This shows us the status of each pool and the status of our mirroring.


	# cd /media


In ZFS we have what is known as a dataset. A dataset gives us great flexibility with ZFS snapshots and makes backing up or copying snapshots so easy.


	# zfs create media/data

	# ls /media/data

	# zfs list


This will shows you our ZFS datasets.

We can compress data in a dataset transparently:


	zfs set compression=gzip media/data



                             STRIPES


How would I creata a stripe?


	# zpool create media /dev/da1 /dev/da2


Note: we don't tell it what type of zpool we want as the default is stripe.

And again we can create our dataset beneath that and compress it as before.




                       DESTROYING A DATASET


To destroy a dataset:


	# zpool destroy media
