	     CHANGING ASSOCIATION TO ANOTHER YUBIKEY




If you created your GPG keys using an alternate directory (setting
$GNUPGHOME to another directory), then GPG will not know anything
about the keys on your Yubikey.

You can recover this by removing $GNUPGHOME, and insert your Yubikey.
If you have set the URL to where your public key can be found:


	$ gpg --edit-card

	gpg/card>  list

	(shows nothing)

	gpg/card>  fetch

	(shows GPG pulling the public key from the card's URL)

	gpg/card>  list

	(shows your key)

	$


Note:   Entries showing

	'ssb#' indicates that the keys are on ANOTHER card.

	'ssb>' indicates that the keys are associated with THIS
	card



If you need to change which card is associated with a key, you can
do something like:


	$ gpg --with-keygrip -K 27470C40DF746792

	....


The keygrip for each subkey will correspond to a file under
~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/ directory. Delete these files and run
'gpg --card-status' to get them re-associated with the new card.

Now gpg has your key and knows to look on your card for the secret
parts.

Edit ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf and set the default-key to your signing
subkey.

And test:


	$ echo test | gpg -ear 27470C40DF746792 --sign | gpg -d


You should be prompted for your PIN if you haven't typed it in
recently.
