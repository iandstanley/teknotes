		    FIREFOX HARDENING IN 2022



There are a number of things you can do to improve your security
and privacy in Firefox in 2022. It should be noted that the TOR
Browser or TAILS OS is a much better solution for privacy.


	--------------------------------------------------------------


			    EASY STUFF


- enable automatic updates for newest patches

- disable 'Recommended extensions as you browse' and 'Features as
  you browse'

- for most users, enable DNS over HTTPS, and change from CloudFlare
  to a more privacy respecting provider: (e.g.
  https://dns.quad9.net/dns-query)

- disable snippets

- disable recent activity

- change search engine to a privacy orientated engine such as
  DuckDuckGo or StartPage

- disable 'Provide Search Suggestions'

- set Firefox's Privacy Protections to STRICT

- enable 'Delete Cookies and Site Data when Firefox is closed', and
  utilize exceptions for any sites you want to stay logged in (NOT
  RECOMMENDED)

- disable popups in the address bar (Firefox Suggest)

- disable all 'Firefox data collection and use' settings

- enable ALL 'Security' options (eg. Block Dangerous and deceptive
  content) ...

- Firefox 83 introduced 'HTTPS Only' mode, so enable HTTPS ONLY in
  ALL windows. This negates the need for 'HTTPS Everywhere' which
  is becoming end-of-life.

- finally, avoid untrusted extensions at all cost.

This puts you ahead of 99% of all people in the world.



	--------------------------------------------------------------


			  MODERATE STUFF


- Javascript Storage APIs can be used for cross site tracking. If
  you toggled the STRICT Privacy Protection mentioned above turned
  on, Firefox uses Dynamic State Partitioning protection to prevent
  this.

- website isolation with FISSION is a fairly new and important
  security feature which is not currently enabled by default in
  production Firefox. To enable, load the 'about:config' page into
  Firefox and search for 'fission'. Set 'fission.autostart' to
  'true' and restart your browser. This is important and may become
  ON by default in coming months.

- Let's talk about extensions. Lets cover what to install.

	* UBLOCK ORIGIN for ad tracking, and script protection

	* FIREFOX MULTI-ACCOUNT CONTAINERS for better compartmentalization

	* SMART REFERRER in strict mode (?)

	* SKIP DIRECT (?)

	* CANVAS BLOCKER (?) (Note: Firefox has its own canvas
	protection now)

  In fact ALL of these are semi-questionable, with the exception
  of UBLOCK ORIGIN.

  Note:

	* UMATRIX is no longer maintained and should be removed
	  (UBLOCK ORIGIN covers most of the functionality)

	* GHOSTERY, DISCONNECT, PRIVACY BADGER, DUCKDUCKGO PRIVACY
	  ESSENTIALS & tracker blockers aren't really needed with
	  everythng we have done already.

	* NEAT URL, CLEAR URLS are replaced by UBLOCK ORIGIN

	* HTTPS EVERYWHERE is scheduled for deprecation and is
	  replaced with Firefox's internal settings

	* LOCAL CDN, DECENTRALEYES have their own issues that can
	  make things worse

	* Other extensions may not benefit you


	--------------------------------------------------------------


		     ADVANCED HARDENING TIPS



We truely live in an age of Firefox hardening.

ARKENFOX is a project that handles almost all of the advanced
hardening techniques convieniently. Installing the file is very
simple:

	- open Firefox

	- goto 'Help' -> 'More Troubleshooting Information'

	- Next to 'Profile Folder', click 'Open Directory'

	- copy/move the 'user.js' from Arkenfox there


The ARKENFOX wiki can help you get started, AS WELL AS OVERRIDE
some settings to avoid site breakage which will not happen by
default: this is not a drag and drop thing like installing an
extension, it is much more involved that that - so don't do it
unless you are comfortable.

Keep in mind, if you use ARKENFOX and enable RFP (which is explained
in their Wiki) then SMART REFERRER and CANVAS BLOCKER are certainly
not needed.


Finally, a BONUS SUPER TIP:


	INSTALL THE TOR BROWSER alongside hardened Firefox is as
	good for protecting you from fingerprinting as the TOR
	Browser standardises the browser to share the same
	settings/window size/extensions/etc as every other TOR
	Browser. The TOR Browser is designed and configured to
	resist fingerprinting.

	Every browser straight out of the box has been proven by
	research papers to be very fingerprintable.
