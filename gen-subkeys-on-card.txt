	  GENERATING SUBKEYS ON A CARD AND ADD TO A KEY



After we have generated a regular gpg key we can add a subkey to a
card and attach it to the current key.


	gpg> addcardkey


It is similar to addkey but key is generated on the card itself.


This is useful particularly if you generate a key but want individual
auth subkeys on different Yubikeys to make it simpler to revoke
individual keys.
