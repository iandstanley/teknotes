	      NEED A WEBSITE QUICKLY WITH WORDPRESS




	% su -


Install from binary packages:


	# pkg install nginx php74 wordpress


This will take a couple of minutes.


	# cd /usr/local/etc/nginx
	# vi nginx.conf


Add the following line BEFORE the closing } brace:


	include conf.d/*.conf



Now create a conf.d directory for nginx:


	# mkdir conf.d && cd conf.d
	# vi mydomain.conf              # or 10.148.86.127.conf


	# HTTPS server for 10.148.86.127

	server {

		listen 80;
		server_name     10.148.86.127

		root	/usr/local/www/wordpress;
		index	index.php;
		location	~ \.php$ {

			try_files $uri=404;
			fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
			fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php74-fpm.sock;
			fastcgi_index index.php;
			fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
			include fastcgi_param;
		}

		location / {
			try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
		}

		# Disable access to user.ini files

		location ~/\.user.ini {
			deny all;
		}
	}



That's all we need to do with nginx for now.


	# cd /usr/local/etc/php-fpm.d/
	# vi www.conf


And change the listening address to:


	listen= /var/run/php74-fpm.sock


So we are going to listen on a Linux socket.

We will also uncomment the 3 lines owner, group and mode of the
socket.


	listen.owner=www

	listen.group=www

	listen.mode=0660


Now we need to enable all of this in our rc.conf file :


	# vi /etc/rc.conf

	nginx_enable="YES"
	php_fpm_enable="YES"


	# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nginx start
	# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/php-fpm start

	# tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log & 

	# firefox 10.148.86.127/


And we have our Wordpress setup page and work our way through the
installation scripts.
