I'm going to show you how you can chat on an IRC channel using
netcat. Netcat is the swiss army knife of networking, basically
giving you a RAW TCP connection to work with.



	$ sudo apt install -y netcat


To connect to an IRC server:


	$ nc irc.devdungeon.com 6667


If you use the wrong port you will get a message like:


	irc.devdungeon.com [192.53.170.182] 668 (?): 
				Connection Refused


Once you are online you will need to register a user name and
nickname.


	$ nc irc.devdungeon.com 6667
	:irc.devdungeon.com NOTICE: *** Looking up your hostname ...
	:irc.devdungeon.com NOTICE: *** could not resolve your hostname
				Domain not found; using your IP address
				(107.181.165.217) instead
	


If you wait for a minute or so, eventually the server will close
the connection with:

	ERROR: Closing link (096AAAC@107.181.165.217) 
				[Registration timeout]


So you need to complete the registration in under a minute (defaults
for most servers)


To register you use the USER command which has the format:


	USER <username> <hostname> <servername> <realname> (RFC1459)

	USER <username> <mode> <unused> <realname> (RFC2812)


And you nickname with the NICK command:


	NICK <nickname>  [<hopcount>]  (RFC1459)

	NICK <nickname>    (RFC2812)


Your USER is for formal identification with the server but your
nickname is how you will appear to other users, and how they will
address you.


	$ nc irc.devdungeon.com 6667
	........
	........

	USER johnq * * :John Q Hacker


You don't need to know what the two asterisks mean. Your username
here would be johnq and your "real name" is ":John Q Hacker". You
place a colon before the real name as it can have spaces in it.


Next you need to set your nickname:


	NICK  johnq


Or whatever you want your display name to be.


The server responds with a bunch of messages.

:irc.devdungeon.com 001 johnq: Welcome to DevDungeon IRC
....
....
:irc.devdungeon.com 251 johnq: There are 1 users and 0
				invisble on 1 server
....
....
:irc.devdungeon.com 375 johnq: irc.devdungeon.com message of the day
:irc.devdungeon.com 372 johnq: Welcome to Devdungeon
:irc.devdungeon.com 376 johnq: End of message of the day
													
Once you are connected you can retain your username whilst changing
your nickname many times.

After the server processes your registration successfully it will
send you the message of the day along with some server information.

Now we are fully recognised as an irc client. At this point you can
start messaging people, joining channels and making queries to the
server about channels etc.


To message someone use PRIVMSG:


	PRIVMSG nanodano hey dano


This will only work if somebody is already logged into that server
with the nickname nanodano.


To get a list of char rooms:


	LIST
	:irc.devdungeon.com 321 johnq channel: Users name
	:irc.devdungeon.com 322 johnq #general 1
	:irc.devdungeon.com 323 johnq :End of channel list



To join one of those channels (eg general):


	JOIN #general
	:johnq!johnq@107.181.165.217 JOIN #general
	:irc.devdungeon.com 353 johnq = #general :johnq nanodano
	:irc.devdungeon.com 356 johnq #general :End of /NAMES list



To chat in the channel we use PRIVMSG as before but we give it the
channel name (starting with #):


	PRIVMSG #general  Hello general channel!



To get a list of users in the #general channel:


	WHO #general


To get more information about a user, like the real name they
provided:


	WHOIS nanodano
	:irc.devdungeon.com!johnq@107.181.165.217 PRIVMSG 
					johnq :Hello johnq
	:irc.devdungeon.com!johnq@107.181.165.217 PRIVMSG 
					#general :Welcome


In these messages you will see who sent the message and after PRIVMSG
you will see a destination (a channel name or your username). After
the colon is the message.


To respond use the PRIVMSG command:


	PRIVMSG  #general Glad to be here
	PRIVMSG  nanodano  see you later



So now you have an active client connection to the IRC server. You
know how to list the channels and find somewhere to chat. You know
how to join a channel. You know how to check who is in the channel.
And you know how to send messages to a channel or a specific user.
You're pretty much all set.



After you have been connnected for a while you wil recieve a notice
from the server:


	PING :irc.devdungeon.com


It will say PING followed by some text (often the server name). You
must respond with PONG followed by the same text:


	PONG :irc.devdungeon.com


If you don't your connection will timeout:


	ERROR: Closing link (johnq@107.181.165.217) [ping timeout]

Internet Relay Chat commands"
