Do you need a tor bridge? And for that matter, what is a TOR bridge?

A TOR bridge takes the place of an entry guard.

Normally:

	Client 	   Entry    Middle    Exit     Server
	Machine -> Guard -> Relays -> Relay -> Machine
		   Relay


When you connect to the TOR network, your first relay is going to
be an entry node (guard). You are then going to route all your
traffic through a number of relays. Finally hitting an exit relay
(if accessing the regular internet); else hitting the TOR hidden
service server.

If we look at our TOR settings in the TOR Browser, we can request
a bridge by selecting 'Use a bridge'. We can choose the type of
bridge as well (eg OBS4 and others).

For countries where the ISPs censor TOR, then you should be using
a bridge.

A bridge is a way to further decentralize part of your connection
from the publically listed TOR relays on the internet. If you have
the most concerns of surveillance capitalism, I would recommend
using the Snowflake bridge. This is because the snowflake bridge
is actually a browser extension that continually changes to a new
random bridge from the unlisted entry guards of snowflake bridges.

Snowflake mimics WebRTC so it actually looks like a video chat when
you are connected to it.

After selecting snowflake we can then go back to connect to TOR.
We can even set this to do this automatically.

So if you are concerned about censorship and of the blocking of
TOR, like what happens in China, you are going to want to try a
bridge.

The people that NEED a bridge are the people who are worried about
censorship and blocking of TOR.

If you don't live in a country where this happens, then try to save
the bridges for people who really need them.

You will notice that if you are on a bridge connection will be
slower than a regular TOR connection.
