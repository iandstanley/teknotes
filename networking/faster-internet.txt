FASTER INTERNET ===============

This can be done by increasing the size of the MTU (maximum
transmission unit)

What is the maximum data packet our computer can handle?

* Tell the computer to set the MTU size

eg. (on Windows)

> netsh ipv4 show interfaces

	MTU 576 ................... Ethernet

Then run a download speedtest, result say = 148MBps

> ping google.com -f -l 1492

Packet needs to show being fragmented but DF set

Then repeat lowering the packet size on each repeat to find out
what packet size does not produce any fragmentation then stop.

> ping google.com -f -l 1472

Finally we have 0% packet loss and NO fragmentation.

Now start increamenting the packet size by 1 to see when it fragments
again.

To calculate the MTU size:

	1472    max unfragmented size
	 +28    packet header size
	---- 
	1500    MTU size

Now we need to tell the system to use it (ideally at the router).

Switch MTU from auto to manual OR on each computer

> netsh int ipv4 set subinterface "Ethernet" mtu=1500 store=persistent

Now re-run the speed test and see the improvement.
