DISABLE PINGS TO YOUR SERVER
============================

To obscure or hide servers on the network we can block pings to
stop trivial identification and also prevent ICMP DOS attacks.


Not responding to pings makes servers less visible.

Show the default settings:

	# sysctl -ar 'icmp_echo'

	net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 0
	net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

Change settings:

	# sysctl -w net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1
