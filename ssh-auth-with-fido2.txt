Q.      I was wondering if it is possible to use FIDO2/U2F to
	authenticate against an ssh server (eg. Yubico Security
	Key)



                            SOLUTION 1

OpenSSH v8.2 has added support for FIDO/U2F (without a need for a
patch).

In OpenSSH, FIDO devices are supported by public key types ecdsa-sk
and ed25519-sk along with the corresponding certificate types.

ssh-keyen(1) may be used to generate a FIDO-backed key:


	$ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -f ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa-sk




                            SOLUTION 2

You can use the PAMs provided by Yubico.

	libpam-yubico for OTP
		see developers.yubico.com/yubico-pam/

	libpam-U2F for U2F
		can't be used with ssh since it uses libusb/local
		ports


You don't need a PPA as its already in Debian.
