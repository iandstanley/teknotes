PIUS KEYSIGNING PARTY
=====================

Pius is made up of 3 programs to make your PGP/GPG keysigning activities easier.

PIUS (PGP Individual UID Signer) helps attendees of PGP keysigning parties designed to take the pain out of the sign-all-the-keys part of PGP keysigning parties.

PIUS-KEYRING-MANAGER

This helps organizers of PGP keysigning parties. It allows you to build and manage party keyrings.

It can parse CSV files and mailboxes looking for fingerprints and keys and build a keyring for you. It can also email anyone whose fingerprint didn't allow you to find a key. It also allows you to prune down keyrings of users who didn't attend the event.

PIUS-PARTY-WORKSHEET

This is also for organisersof PGP keysigning parties. It is a small utility to generate a worksheet based on the party keyring. 

This worksheet can eb given to all attendees to help them verify keys and identities.
