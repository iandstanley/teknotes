Get the SHA256 of the iso file with

$ sha256sum -b *.iso

Confirm that the sha256 sum is the same as that in the sha256sum.txt
file

Get the public keys 

$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com \
	--recv-key "27DE B156 ....... AB09"

-or-

$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com \
	--recv-key A25BAE09

List the key for this fingerprint:

$ gp g--list-key --with-fingerprint A25BAE09

Verify that this is the right key.

Verify the downloaded files

$ gpg  --verify sha256sum.txt.gpg sha256sum.txt

Verify that the key used was A25BAE09
