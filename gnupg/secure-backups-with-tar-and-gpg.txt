SECURE BACKUPS WITH TAR & GPG
=============================

	$ tar -c /etc | gpg -r backup@me.com \
		-o /tmp/backup.tar.gpg

All I had to do was import my GPG public key onto the server and
import it into my keyring.

The private key is found elsewhere securely saved so that only I
can restore it.
