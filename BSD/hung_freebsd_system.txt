                    (from Handbook 12.13.2.3)



Most system hangs are a result of lost interrupts, or an interrupt
storm. Chipsets may have problems based on boot, how BIOS configures
interrupts, correctness of APIC (MADT), or SCI routing.


                        INTERRUPTS STORMS

Interrupts Storms can be distinguished from lost interrupts by
checking:

	$ vmstat -i

If counter increases > 2 /second then you have an Interrupt Storm.

If hung CTRL-ALT-ESC on console to get into DDB and type:

	> show interupts

When dealing with interrupt problems, try disabling APIC support
with:, try disabling APIC support with:

	hint.apic.0.disable="1"

in '/boot/loader.conf'.





                              PANICS
                     (see Handbook 12.13.2.4)


Panics are relatively rare for ACPI.

First, isloate the steps to reproduce the panic. If possible get a
stacktrace.

Follow the advice for enabling 'options' DDB and setting up a serial
console or setup a 'dump' partition.

To get a backtrace in DDB, use 'tr' (get at least top 5 and last 5
lines).






                               ACPI
                     (see Handbook 12.13.2.2)

Use 
	# sysctl hw.acpi

to check suspend related items.  Use 

	# acpiconf -s 

to test S3, S4, and S5.


Test S1 first as this is most likely.

Common problem with suspend/resume is that many drives do not
save/restore or reinitialize firmware, registers or device memory.


Try:

	# sysctl debug.bootverbose = 1
	# sysctl debug.acpi.suspend_bounce = 1
	# acpiconf -s3

This test emulates the suspend/resume cycle of all device drivers
without going into S3 state.

If that works you can configure 'suspendonlidclose':

	# sysctl hw.acpi.lid_switch_state=S3

or, add it to /etc/sysctl.conf.





                   BIOS CONTAINS BAD BYTE CODE
                     (see Handbook 12.13.2.6)


	eg. 	ACPI-1287 Error ...........




                          DUMP ASL
                      (see Handbook 12.13.3)


	# acpidump -td > my.asl



Some versions of asl versions assume user is running Windows.

To override this, set:

	hw.acpi.osname="Windows 2009"

in '/boot/loader.conf'
