# WHAT ABOUt WIFI ON OPENBSD?


(1)     You've installed OpenBSD and booted it up for the first
	time. Here's how you can get wifi set up.

	# ifconfig

	This lists your network interfaces. Wifi devices should be
	indicated as "nwid" or "IEEE802.11" listed beneath it.

	eg. we could see "bwfm0"

	To be sure we can type:

		# whatis bfwm

		bwfm(4) - Broadcom and Cypress IEEE 802.11a/ac/b/g/n
		wireless network device.

	If you don't have a supported wifi device we recommend
	purchasing a EDIMAX EW-7811Un v2 USB wireless device. If
	you plug in an EDIMAX EW7811 you will see the ifconfig
	report a device 'urtwn0'


(2)	We may need to update the firmware for the device:

		# fw_update

	Then reboot your machine:

		# reboot


(3)	Then configure your wifi device:

	# echo nwid mywifi wpakey mywifipassword > /etc/hostname.urtwn0 

		(or bwfm0 or whatever the device name is)

	# echo inet autoconf >> /etc/hostname.urtwn0


	And save a copy of your ethernet config:
	
	# mv /etc/hostname.bse0 /etc/hostname.bse0.bak
