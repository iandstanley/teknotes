# NETBSD DOCUMENTATION

NetBSD comes with a bunch of technical articles and research papers
that are still relevant today.

Documentation is already installed into /usr/share/doc/

## Folder Layout

	/usr/share/doc
		|
		+--- papers	published papers
		|
		+--- psd	programmer supplementary docs
		|
		+--- reference	a few reference documents
		|
		+--- smm	system manager manuals
		|
		+--- usd	user supplementary docs


## Formatting of Documentation

If we take a look at one of these documents:

	$ vi papers/mckusick84-ffs/mckusick84-ffs.txt

We see that there is a bunch of control characters all over the
text. This documentation is formatted with the system document
formatting tools.

If we use a pager that can properly display the document:

	$ more papers/mckusick84-ffs/mckusik84-ffs.txt

Now we see bold, underlines and other formats in the text properly.


## Contents of Documentation Folders

You will find that most of the names on the papers are familiar. 

eg.

	$ more papers/morris78-password/morris78-password.txt

This is a paper on password security by Ken Thompson and Robert
Morris Snr (who later became chief scientist at NSA and whose son
Robert Tapping Morris later releaed the infamous Morris worm).

There is an introduction to the UNIX shell by Steven R. Bourne
(reference/ref1/sh/sh.txt).

There is a vi/ex reference manual (reference/ref1/vi/vi.txt). 

We also find the seminal IPC BSD Tutorial
(reference/ref3/sockets/sockets.txt).

Also the advanced IPC tutorial
(reference/ref3/sockets-advanced/sockets-advanced.txt).

There's the Berkeley Software Architecture Manual which describes
all of the system calls and the overall architecture of the system
(reference/ref3/sysman/sysman.txt).

In the User Supplementary directory we see Brian Kerninghan's "Unix
for Beginners - Second Ed." (usd/begin/begin.txt).

Another file is the Vi Quick Reference (usd/vi/summary.txt) as well
as a more detailed Vi Tutorial (usd.vivitut.txt) by Bill Joy the
author of Vi.

## Sources

All of these guides are found in /usr/share/doc/ but as we have the
source for the OS we also have the source for the documents.

	$ cd /usr/src/share/doc/

	$ ls

	cvs	 README.docdirs	psd	standards
	makefile papers		smm	usd

The README gives all the various documentation directories and an
idea of what other documentation is available.

It also notes that some of the historical documents are missing.

These documents are often written using the various *roff macros
and can be typeset and formatted for displays using groff(1),
nroff(1) and troff(1).

	$ cd /usr/src/share/doc/

	$ nroff -ms papers/beyond4.3/beyond43.ms > /tmp/beyond43.ps
