# OpenBSD encrypted disk install

## Boot from USB

Boot to installation program:

	(I)nstall, (U)pgrade, (A)utoinstall or (S)hell?

Enter 's' to get a root shell


## Create disk device

You will usually have a disk sd0 (or on an older machine may be a
wd0).

You can check by running one of:

	# dmesg | grep wd0
	# dmesg | grep sd0

You should seean entry for your harddisk that matches your BIOS
results

	# cd /dev
	# sh MAKEDEV wd0

Then we randomize the bytes on the WHOLE drive to disguise how much
encrypted data is on the disk.

	# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/rwd0c bs=1m
	                               ^--------- for wd0 disk

This will take some time even on smaller disks. wait()


## Write MBR to disk

	# fdisk -iy wd0


## Label the disk

	# disklabel -E wd0
	Label editor
	wd0>			a a
	offset: [64]		<enter>
	size: [625137281]	*
	FS Type: [4.2BSD]	RAID
	wd0*>			w
	wd0>			q
	No label changes
	#

Disklabel says no label changes because we have already written
them to disk.


## Create the encrypted drive

	# bioctl -c C -l wd0a softraid0

	New Passphrase:
	Re-type passphrase:

	sd1: at scsibus1 targ 1 lun0 <OPENBSD, SR CYPTO, 006>
	sd1: 385242 MB, 512 bytes/sector, 625136753 sectors
	softraid0: CRYPTO volume attached as sd1.
	#


## Create actual drive on sd1

	# cd /dev
	# sh MAKEDEV sd1
	# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd1c bs=1m count=1
	  1+0 records in
	  1+0 records out
	  1048576 bytes transferred in 0.112 secs
	# exit


## Now our drive is encrypted we can run the install:

	(I)nstall, (U)pgrade, (A)utoinstall or (S)hell?
