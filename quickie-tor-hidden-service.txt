                 HOST YOUR OWN TOR HIDDEN SERVICE



The first thing I am going to do is create a directory for our
server to live in.


	$ mkdir tor_service && cd tor_service


And start up a temporary webserver on port 8080:


	$ python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1 8080


In a second terminal window:


	$ cd tor_service

	$ ed index.html

	  <html><body><h1>Demo for service</h1></body></html>


This is just a simple webserver with a very simple webpage for us
to test. Test this works with a regular browser at localhost:8080/.
Great this works.


Now for TOR. We will need to install the TOR server:


	$ sudo apt install -y tor


Also if you haven't got a machine with the TOR Browser installed,
you will have to follow the instructions on torproject.org.

Now to configure TOR:


	$ sudo -i 

	# cd /etc/tor/torrc
	# ed torrc

	HiddenServiceDir	/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
	HiddenServicePort	80 127.0.0.1:8080


Here we change the redirected port to 8080 (where our python3 web
server is listening).


	$ sudo tor


Now we should be running a TOR hidden service. This service will
only run as long as the TOR process and the python webserver are
running. A more permanent solution would be to run a proper webserver
and the TOR server as proper services that come up at boot.



In another terminal, let's find out what our new .onion address is:


	$ sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname 
	qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq.onion	


Where qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq.onion is actually a
random set of letters that represents the hash of a public key
unique to the TOR network.

If we copy and paste that .onion address into the TOR browser we
will see our webpage via the TOR network.


NOTE we could also use the Brave Browser.
