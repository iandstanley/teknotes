		HARDENDED BSD LIVE CD (UNOFFICIAL)


This LIVECD version is an unofficial spin by one of the developers
with a preconfigured desktop in a similar manner to GHOSTBSD. It
is a VOLATILE LIVE SESSION OS so it does not save any information
like NomadBSD to install media, but it allows you like GHOSTBSD to
run apps and test the general capabilities of the OS on your target
machine.

Ths live CD runs an XFCE based desktop.

A Lynis security scan scores 69 which is comparable to OpenBSD base
install.
