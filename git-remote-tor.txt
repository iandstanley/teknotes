			github.com/agentofuser/git-remote-tor/


USAGE:

	git clone tor::http://jsdousd702jk...23hr7r9jw3nkd.onion
	git clone tor::https://github.com/agentofuser/logit.git


Crucially the 'tor::' prefix gets added to the .git/config as part
of the remote's URL. So you don't have to do anything special.
Afterwards git fetch origin, git pull etc all run over tor.

Requires:

	$ sudo apt install tor torsocks rust
