               YUBIKEY U2F WON'T WORK WITH FIREFOX



Note the additional setup instructions when you install security/u2f-devd
(which can be found here): 

https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/security/u2f-devd/files/pkg-message.in?revision=508909&view=markup

U2F authentication requires read/write access to USB devices. To
facilitate such access it comes with a devd.conf(5) file, but you
still need to restart devd(8), add the desired users to "u2f" group
and log those out of the current session. For example:

# service devd restart
# pw group mod u2f -m <user>
$ exit

For details, see /usr/local/etc/devd/u2f.conf
