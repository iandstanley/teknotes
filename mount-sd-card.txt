How to mount a FAT32 formatted SD card on FreeBSD. 


1.	Insert the SD card into your reader


	$ dmesg
	mmc0:	<MMC/SD bus> on rtsx0
	mmcsd0:	4GB <SDHC EYEFI 0.0 .....> at mmc0
	$



2. 	Determine the filesystem


	$ sudo gpart show mmcsd0
	.....
	.....
	8192	60628992    1	fat32lba     [active]    (29G)
	$


	You can gather even more info about the filesystem with:


	$ sudo file -s /dev/mmcsd0s1
	.....
	.....



3.	Mount the FAT32 formatted filesystem


	Assuming that you are downloading photos from the SD card
	you will only want to have the SD card read-only.
	

	$ sudo mount -t msdos -o ro /dev/mmcsd0s1 /mnt


	However, if you want to write to the card then you should
	specify 'rw' in the options to enable writes.


	$ sudo mount -t msdos -o rw /dev/mmcsd0s1 /mnt



4. 	Umount when done


	$ sudo umount /mnt
