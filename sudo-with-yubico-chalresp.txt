	SUDO WITH YUBICO CHALLENGE RESPONSE AUTHENTICATION


We want to protect our sudo access with a Challenge-Response held
on a Yubikey.


	$ sudo apt install -y libpam-yubico yubikey-manager


Create a challenge-response on the Yubikey.


	$ ykman otp chalresp -g2 
	Using a randomly generated key: 150245a98b75f4e9875c213fd97
	....  
	Program a challenge-response credential in slot 2? [y/N]  y 
	.....
	....
	$ 


Now you have the challenge-response credential in slot 2 of your
Yubikey (long press).

Now we need to associate this specific key with this challenge-response
credential with your user account.


	$ ykpamcfg -2
	Stored initial challenge and expected response in 
	'/home/william/.yubico/challenge-8693844'
	$


Where 8693844 is the serial no of your Yubikey.


	$ cd /etc/pam.d/
	$ sudo nano sudo

And insert the line:


	@include yubico-required


Now we will create the config 'yubico-required':


	$ sudo nano yubico-required


And add the single line:

	auth required pam_yubico.so mode=challenge-response 
			chalresp_path=/etc/yubico



                          Yubikey Login
			  """""""""""""

Requiring the Yubikey for login (via the graphical login manager
GDM):


	$ cd /etc/pam.d/
	$ ls 
	........... gdm-password ........

	$ sudo nano gdm-password


		@include yubico-required



Which includes the yubico-required file into the gdm-password
configuration.

We now require the Yubikey to login via gdm.

Note: you should also look at the files 'login' and 'sshd'.

You could even add an include file to 'su', 'su-l', 'passwd' and
other files.
