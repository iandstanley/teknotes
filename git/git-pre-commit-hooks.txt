		       GIT PRE-COMMIT HOOKS



This and other hooks are found in .git/hooks/.

Sample scripts are found there to help you get started.

Typically one would use linters and code beautifiers at this point.

Ususally if a code beautifier amends a file you have to 'git add'
and 'git commit' a second time.

If you don't like the changes then you can 'git restore' to original
formatting.

For some languages (notably omitting C) there are a bunch of sample
pre-commit hooks at pre-commit.com/hooks.html

For C hooks try:

	   opensourcelibs.com/lib/poce-pre-commit-hooks

This repo contans pre-commit hooks integrating 2 C/C++ code formatters:

		   clang-format and uncrustify

and 5 C/C++ static code analysers:

   clang-tidy, oclint, cppcheck, cpplint, include-what-you-use
