# XORG XFILES


The .xinitrc, .Xsession and .xprofile files appear to be basically
the same thing. They do pretty much the same thing but in slightly
different ways.


## The .xinitrc file

You can use just an .xinitrc if you don't use a display manager.
The .xinitrc is used by 'xinit' or 'startx' when startxing Xorg.

Your last line of .xinitrc should execute your window manager e.g.
'exec dwm'.


## The .Xsession file

What about .xsession? .xsession is written line by line almost
identical to .xinitrc but .xsession is used by a display manager.
Typically you don't use them with *most* modern display managers.

Prior to display managers being able to determine what graphical
environments you actually ahev installed, it would actually look
at your xsession files and use it's contents to let you choose from
what environments you could log into.

You could launch specific applications for Gnome, for example.

Nowadays, selecting the graphical environment is typically done
automatically so the xsession files see much less usage.


## The .xprofile file

The .xprofile file is used by a display manager (the login manager).
It is bascially the same as the .xinitrc but without the final
'exec' command which is chosen by the login manager (display manager).
Some display managers choose to use an .xsession file instead.


## The .Xauthority file

The .Xauthority is not written to by hand. Xorg stores your login
credentials in the form of a cookie and is used to authenticate
your connection to the display.

You need write permissions to this file else X11 freezes (you can
use ctrl-c a couple of times to unfreeze and delete the .Xauthority
file and restart your X server to regenerate the file).


To show all of the cookies in the file:

	$ xauth list

The .Xauthority-c, .Xauthority-l, and .Xauthority-n are temporary
files. So if they stay around then you have a problem with your
.Xauthority file.


## The .Xresources file

The .Xresouces sets up a bunch of things like foreground and
background colors, font dpi, and a series of other settings used
by X11 applications on the system.  Sometimes  you have some low
level settings for other applications like xcursor, xurxvt,
xscreensaver, xclock, xpdf etc.

Most terminals except urxvt and XTerm don't acknowledge .Xresources.
most other apps ignore it.

You can source the .Xresources file in your .xinitrc with the command:

	xrdb -load ~/.config/X11/.Xresources

## Managing keyboard mapping in X

The program xmodmap file (which could be named anything) is generated
by:

	$ xmodmap  -pke > .xmodmap

You can then edit the file to remap kays. 

The xmodmap file is loaded in .xinitrc with:

	xmodmap ~/.config/xmodmap &
