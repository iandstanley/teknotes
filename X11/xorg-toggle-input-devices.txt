XORG XINPUT: TOGGLE ON/OFF ANY INPUT DEVICE


e.g. temporarily disable touchpad, or disable a webcam for privacy.

NB don't disable kayboard unless you have another input method
available.


(1)	install xinput

(2)	list devices:

	$ xinput list

(3)     look for the if of the device. Note the ids will change
	depending on  the order they are found by the bios or plugged
	in.


(4)	look at the properties of te device

	$ xinput --list-props //
	                       ^-- id or name

	To disable/enable we need to look for the property:

	'DeviceEnabled' (169)   - once again these can change with
			  ^	 driver updates
			  +--- id

(5)	Change property to disable:

	$ xinput --set-prop // "Device Enabled" 0
			     ^--- id or name 

(6)	To re-enable just change the property back to 1

A good idea is to script the toggle
