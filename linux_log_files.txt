		  HOW TO HANDLE LINUX LOG FILES


For example, I have a firewall that runs and it constantly inserts
messages when it denies access to a port. That's good. I want that
information, but it is collecting it into my syslog file and
cluttering things up so I cannot see the ususal syslog messages.




			     RSYSLOGD

Rsyslogd is the daemon what controls what messages are placed where.

It's configuration file is /etc/rsyslog.conf plus any additional
files in /etc/rsyslog.d/ directory.

Typically you would add your customisations to the /etc/rsyslog.d/
directory leaving the main configuration file alone unless absolutely
necessary.

The main configuration file /etc/rsyslog.conf should be used for
rsyslogd configuration and the system level messages it is handling.

Application and custom configurations should be added in one or
more files in the /etc/rsyslog.d/ directory. Each file is prefixed
with a number in order to specify the order of loading (via file
globbing).





		  LETS ADD A CONFIGURATION FILE

# cd /etc/rsyslog.d/

# vi 39-firewall.conf

	# Log kernel generated messages to file 

	:msg, contains, "Dropped by firewall:" /var/log/iptables.log


We need to restart rsyslogd to take effect of new or changed config
files.




                           LOG ROTATION


The next problem we will have is that the log file will continue
to grow until we fill the filesystem.

To manage this we use the logrotate utility.


	$ man logrotate

The command logrotate(1) rotates, compresses and emails system logs.

The logrotate(1) configuration file is /etc/logrotate.conf (plus
any subfiles in /etc/logrotate.d/).

In logrotate.conf you should put the general settings for logrotated
daemon. You will notice an include statement to import the contents
of files in the /etc/logrotate.d directory.

There is also an rsyslog config file specifying what to do with rsyslogd managed logfiles.


	# view /etc/rsyslog.conf

	/var/log/mail.warn
	/var/log/cron.log
	...
	...
	{
		rotate 4
		weekly
		missing ok
		notifempty
		delaycompress
		sharedscripts
		poststate
			/usr/lib/rsyslog/rsyslog.rotate
		endscript
	}
	...
	...


We can force a logrotate with:

	# logrotate -f ./rsyslog


The command delaycompress does not compress the .1 logs but only
the .2 and onwards allowing the admin to read the logs without
having to uncompress them first.


Add our custom logrotation configurations in a new file in
/etc/logrotate.d/.

This is where we should place our application specific configurations.
