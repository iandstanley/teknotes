Using GPG keys on Yubikeys across multiple computers
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To generate a GPG key on a Yubikey you need to run the following commands 
to create the GPG key on the Yubikey itself:

$ gpg --card-status
(read to see what card is attached and report back)

$ gpg --card-edit
gpg> admin
gpg> generate
...
...

gpg> key 1
(select each key in turn and move to card)
...
gpg> keytocard
...
gpg> quit

When you run 'keytocard' GPG creates a stub in your keyring pointing to
the Yubikey by serial number.

Running GPG operations will then prompt the user to insert the Yubikey
into the computer before prompting for a pin number etc.

Using the Yubikey on another computer
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Now things get a little more complicated as the new computer will not have 
the stubs pointing to the Yubikey in the keyring.

In order to rectify this you will need to perform the following commands:

$ gpg --card-status
(makes GPG look for a inserted Yubikey)

$ gpg --card-edit
gpg> fetch

(fetches the public key from the URL that you previously setup and creates 
the stubs pointing to this Yubikey)

You may now continue to use the Yubikey as expected.

Issues using a Yubikey resident GPG key on an account you have 'su -' to
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When you switch to another account using "su - accountname" you will be 
able to perform most of the things you would expect to do with GPG with 
that new account. However, if pin operations are required (which is default
for gpg decryption) then you will find that the backend 'pinentry' program 
fails.

This is because of the permissions on the psuedo tty that you are using.

$ tty 
/dev/pts/2

$ ls -la /dev/pts/2
crw--w----  1 ian  tty  136, 2 Jun  4 23:36 2

Notice that the pts is owned by your original user and not the user you have 
su - to.

Now you could change the 'other user' permissions but that would be bad 
security.

The correct way to do this is to change your su command options:

$ su - --pty testuser

The --pty option creates a new pts tty and sets the ownership to the new user

You will find that all 'pinentry' operations now work without problems.
