# Activate Debian 10 “Buster” Dynamic-motd

I like dynamic motd because you can have information of your choice 
about the system then your login. I have used some sort of motd on most 
of my servers and I also wanted to use it on my newest server, a Debian 
10.0.4 machine.

It was not what simple.
1. Are motd running?

It seems like dynamic motd are turned off by default in Debian 10, we 
can check if it is enabled or not by running this command.

	systemctl status motd
	   motd.service
	   Loaded: masked (/dev/null)
	   Active: inactive (dead)

	# We can also chack with file command
	file /lib/systemd/system/motd.service
	/lib/systemd/system/motd.service: symbolic link to /dev/null

	# just remove the file
	rm /lib/systemd/system/motd.service

	# reload daemon
	systemctl daemon-reload

Ok now we got motd running in Debian again, now we must activate for ssh 
so it will show up then we log into the computer.

## Config files

We need to change two configuration files: sshd_config and pam.d/ssh

First, we need to tell sshd_config to let pam control motd.

	# Alter or add this lines in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	UsePAM yes
	PrintMotd no

Yes, it supposed to say “PrintMotd no” otherwise we will end up with 
multiple motd than we are log in and one of them will not be dynamic.

Don’t forget to reload ssh after you edited the config file

	/etc/init.d/ssh reload

The other file we need to edit is a pam config file for ssh

	# alter or add this lines in /etc/pam.d/ssh

	session    optional     pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic
	# session    optional     pam_motd.so noupdate

Now the system is prepared for running dynamic motd. Now we just need to 
create our motd.

## Dependencies

First, we install the dependencies.

	apt update && apt install figlet 
	mkdir /etc/update-motd.d

With all dependencies and catalog in place, we can now create our motd 
files. I have not created this motd, I just added disk usage.

	echo
	printf "Disk usage:n"
	df -h | grep -e 'sda' -e 'sdb' -e 'sdc' | sort
	EOF

lastly, we need to make the files executable

	chmod +x /etc/update-motd.d/*

Now you just need to log out and log in again to see your dynamic-motd. 
If it’s not working, perhaps you need to reboot the computer to activate 
the changes in pam.
