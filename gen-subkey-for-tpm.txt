               GENERATING A SECRET SUBKEY FOR A TPM



Once you have generated a normal gpg key and added some subkeys you
can transfer a subkey to a TPM module using the command:


	gpg>  keytotpm


This generates a copy of the key in TPM format. 


TPM v2.0 only supports rsa2048 and nistp256 as a minimum, more modern TPMs may support other options.


The key isn't transformed to the TPM, but merely encrypted by the TPM, so if the keyfile is deleted, the key is lost. The key file cannot be converted back.
