		UPDATING FreeBSD USING SOURCE TREE



Updating FreeBSD from te source is fairly simple to do with only a
few commands. It does take a bit of time adn a lot longer than
FreeBSD-update.

Building FreeBSD from source means that FreeBSD is completely
customized to your hardware.


	# cd /usr/src


You can also do a custom kernel here if you really want. For example,
if you have a Mac Mini you will need to add in certain network
devices just to get wifi working.


	# cd /usr/src

	# cp sys/amd64/conf/GENERAL sys/amd64/conf/MacMini

	# vi sys/amd64/conf/MacMini


And now you can edit your build config as desired.


Bulilding your system from source:


	# make buildworld


This step can take a fair few hours depending on your hardware: for
example a Core2 Duo took overnight.

Once you have finished building world, the next thing is to build
the kernel.


	# make buildkernel KERNCONF=MacMini


The kernel build took around 30 minutes on a Core2 Duo.

The next command would be to install that kernel.


	# make installkernel KERNCONF=MacMini


The next step is to install world:


	# make installworld


Once this is all installed you can literally just reboot.

There are a few other things you can do, and it is especially
important IF you are upgrading between major versions:


Before running 'make installworld' you should run 'mergemaster -Fp' which will run through your /etc and a few other config directories and gather the differences. Again thi is only really important when you are going across major version updates:


	# mergemaster -Fp

	# make installworld

	# mergemaster -Fi


This will give you the changes to be included.

Delete your old libraries:


	# make delete-old

	# reboot


Reboot and you are done.

It's a little bit time consuming, but you and up with a TAILORED OS.
