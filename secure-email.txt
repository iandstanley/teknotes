	Onionmail is an anonymous and encrypted mail server made
	to run on the TOR network WITHOUT losing the ability to
	communicate with the Internet. All Onionmail servers are
	configured to run as a TOR Hidden Service and use SSL (via
	STARTTLS).

	To use onionmail all you need is an email client connected
	to the TOR network (eg ClawsMail or Thunderbird).

	In the event of theft OnionMail does not reveal any sensitive
	data. OnionMail server type uses asymetric encryption.

	Each inbox is encrypted with RSA asymmetric keys with
	different user's passwords. Obtaining the keys of the server,
	nobody can read message from user's inbox.

	All data is encrypted and chopped files are hashed. The
	messages are only saved on the server of the recipient.

	OnionMail uses POP3 with SSL to obligate the user to read
	all messages and delete all messages from the server.

	Every file deleted is wiped.

	The master key of the server is nto on the server.

	The server has auto-destruction certificates that destroy
	all keys on f(x) servers allowing deletion of keys in the
	event of theft or seizure WITHOUT SERVER ACCESS.

	Supports unlimited aliases

	Simple to install:

		1. Add apt repository to Debian 8-11, Raspbian

		2. apt install apt-transport-https

		3. apt install onionmail

		4. Configure with 'omn-configure'

                      BURNER EMAIL SERVICES



It is sometimes good to use a burner email - an email address you
will only use for a short time and then destroy. This can be done
by creating an email account with false information, but many email
providers require details that identify the individual like phone
numbers etc. Others block people coming to their site over an
anonymous network like TOR.

	emailondeck.com

	10minuteemail.com

	maildrop.cc

	guerillaemail.com

	throwawayemail.com


	TempMail

		- disposble email addresses (receive only)
		- temp-mail.org/en
		- similar to guerilla mail etc

	altaddress

                          SENDING EMAILS


First it is always best to encrypt the message and any attachments. 

If you wish to remain anonymous this requires that you either:

	1. use symmetric encryption (which requires another secure
	   method to pass on the encryption key)

	2. use asymmetric encryption but you should use a key-pair
	   with another identity (psuedonym)



You should also be very careful in sending attachments and make
sure that you remove all Metadata from the files you send.

Metadata may contain the time and date when the file was created,
the username who created it, the GPS coordinates or any number of
bits of information that could identify you or the location where
the file was created.


REMOVING METADATA


Windows

	- document inspector is built in

MacOS

	- iLove Metadata Remover (in Mac App store)

Linux 

	- exiftool (also installed in TAILS OS)
	- mat2


There are many other tools that can remove metadata and also online
services (if you can trust them).
