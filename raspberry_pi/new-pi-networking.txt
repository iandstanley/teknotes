SETTING UP NETWORKING ON A NEW PI SERVER
========================================

Setting up a Pi server typically starts with an installation of
Raspberry Pi OS lite (no X)

Unfortunately, this can sometimes cause problems with getting the
network up and running.

Here is the process to use:


	1.	Use Imager to install OS lite to SD card or USB drive

	2. 	Mount the card / drive on your machine.

	3. 	$ sudo touch /media/pi/boot/ssh
	
	4. 	$ cp /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf \
			/media/pi/boot/

The pi will copy the .conf file to the corrent place on the SD
card's /boot and turn on ssh access on boot.
